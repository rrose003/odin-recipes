        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This homemade French bread is crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, and is one of the best things to come out of the oven.&nbsp; This recipe is easier to make than you might think. Try it out and you will never want to go back to those mediocre loaves from the store.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ¼ cups <strong>warm water</strong> around 110 degrees F</b></li>
                <li>1 ½ Tablespoons <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
                <li>1 tablespoon <b>instant</b> or <strong>active dry yeast</strong></li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons <strong>vegetable oil</strong> (olive oil or canola oil also works</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons <b>table salt</b></li>
                <li>5 ½-6 cups <b>all-purpose</b> or <strong>bread flour</strong>, scooped & leveled (776 to 846g)</li>
                <li>1 <strong>large egg</strong> beaten with 1 teaspoon cold water</li>
                <li>Melted <strong>salted butter</strong> for brushing on top of the baked loaves (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instruction Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast and let the yeast proof for 5 minutes until foamy (unless using instant yeast, in which case just skip this step and add it with everything in the next step).</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the salt, oil, and 3 cups of the flour to the yeast mixture. Mix for 1-2 minutes, just until it starts to combine. Add in the remaining flour about half a cup at a time while the mixer is running on low speed, just until the dough forms into a ball that starts to come away from the sides of the bowl and is tacky to the touch. Continue to knead the dough for 2-3 minutes until smooth, adding a little more flour if the dough starts to stick to the sides of the bowl again. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead again for another 1-2 minutes.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Transfer the dough to a large, lightly greased bowl and cover it with a kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap sprayed lightly with cooking spray. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about an hour.</p></li>
                <li><p>When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a clean counter that has been lightly sprayed with cooking spray and divide the dough into two equal sections. Working with one half of the dough at a time, pat it into a large rectangle, roughly 9x13-inches.</p></li>
                <li><p>Roll the dough up starting from the long edges into a tight cylinder, turning the ends under and pinching the edges together to seal. Place seam side down on a perforated French bread pan or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining dough to form the second loaf.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>Cover the loaves with a kitchen towel or a piece of plastic wrap sprayed lightly with cooking spray and let them rise for another 30 minutes, until nearly doubled again in size.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375°F while the loaves are rising. Just before putting the loaves in the oven, brush with egg wash, if using, and cut several gashes on an angle about 2-inches apart along the top of each loaf using a very sharp knife or baker's lame.</p></li>
                <li><p>Transfer the loaves to the oven and toss 3-4 ice cubes onto the bottom of the oven floor and immediately close the oven door.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Brush loaves with melted butter after removing from the oven for a softer crust, if desired.</p></li>
            </ol>
